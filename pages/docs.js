      <p style={{color: "white", fontSize: "18px", marginRight: "10%", marginLeft: "10%", marginBottom: "4%"}}>The popularity of DeSci is increasing everyday as more and more researhers realize the importance of decentralization in Science which today is unfortunately influenced by a few centralized entities. ValenceDAO aims to create an ecosystem for researchers in DeSci to find opportunities, connect with other similar minded researchers to collaborate or work with, monetize their research work and donate/recieve funds for their scientific projects. Below we will go in details about each of these components of ValenceDAO
      </p>

        <b style={{fontSize: "24px", marginBottom: "4%"}}>Finding Opportunities, Connections and monetizing research work </b>
        <br />
        Reseachers will be able to create a valence profile and will have an option to connect, follow and message other reseachers with profile on ValenceDAO. They can also upload their publications and decide which ones to keep open access and which requires their permission to access either for free or for an amount set by them depending on the copyright. This way, the power os brought back in the hands of reseachers instead of centralized journals which charge a high fee to give access to reseach papers. Reseachers will also be able to upload articles and preprints. They can also describe the current projects that they are working on and find others working on similar fields/subjects to increase collaboration.

        <b style={{fontSize: "24px", marginBottom: "4%"}}>Donate/Recieve funds for Scientific Projects </b>
        <br />
        Any Valence profile can create a project they want to recieve donations for any scientific project that they ate working on and any profile can donate for the project they want to see grow. In order for profile to recieve finding, they should mention the milestones they want to achieve given enough funds are recieved and meet them to be able to recieve funds again. They are also entitled to keep the scientific work for which donation have been recieved Open Access to promote Open Science which is one of the major goals of DeSci.

      <p style={{color: "white", fontSize: "18px", marginRight: "10%", marginLeft: "10%", marginBottom: "4%"}}>
        <b style={{fontSize: "24px", marginBottom: "4%"}}>Organization Profiles </b>
        <br />
        DeSci DAOs and organization can also create their Valence Profiles which will have also details including governance which will show all Snapshot proposals past and ongoing, their latest news etc. Individual profiles and get updates about organization profiles by opting to get notifications from them. 
      </p>
      <p style={{color: "white", fontSize: "18px", marginRight: "10%", marginLeft: "10%", marginBottom: "4%"}}>
        In addition to all the above features mentioned, the long term goal is to use AI to suggest profiles to get connect and organizations to follow based on your fields/interests. In short, ValenceDAO wants to create bridge of opportunities and connections for DeSci community.
